# [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) skeleton for [DocPad](https://github.com/bevry/docpad)
Bare essentials for building a modern website with best practices

## Why the fork?
This fork adds [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) to show an example of taking the HTMLBP and minifying and concatenating all the JS and CSS assets into single files and including those in the layout.

## What is different?

### `grunt-config.json`
- This file is contains the object passed to `grunt.initConfig` in `grunt.js`. It has been put into its own file since it is used in `docpad.coffee` to build file lists for inclusion in the layout and deleting unused files.

### `grunt.js`
- This is the Grunt file. It runs `initConfig` with the `grunt-config.json` object. It also registers a `default` task with all the keys from the config file.

### `docpad.coffee`
- I added the helper functions [`getGruntedStyles`]() and [`getGruntedScripts`](). These functions will return all the compiled assets that contain `.min.(css|js)` with the correct base path.
- A [`writeAfter`]() DocPad event. It is based on [this gist](https://gist.github.com/3898915), with some additional functionality. It will run the `default` grunt command. Then it will use your `grunt-config.json` to delete the `src` files since they are no longer needed. It will also delete any empty directories in the 'out/' directory.

### `layouts/default.html.eco`
- The script and style blocks have been replaced with calls to the helper functions described above.
